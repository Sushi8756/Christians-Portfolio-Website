      <h1>My biography</h1>
      <p>My name is Christian Lamas, I was born and raised in Orlando Florida. Currently I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Florida Polytechnic University. I've always had an interest in technology, starting in middle school, I enrolled in every computer related class and continued that focus all throughout high school as well.<br><br>
I love how hands on programming can be, and how satisfying it can be to successfully solve complex problems by debugging and transforming ideas into functional programs. Outside of my studies, I also enjoy creating and editing videos on YouTube, which allows me to express my creativity while also improving my skills in digital media creation. I really like expressing my creativity in this form.<br><br>
I value integrity, persistence, and improvement in both personal and work life. As I continue my education, I dream to apply all of these principles to future internships and career opportunities in the Computer Science field.</p>

      <h1>Career Summary and Goals</h1>
      <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Florida Polytechnic University with a strong interest in software engineering and game development. Currently I have basic experience working with Python, Lua, and HTML, but by the time I graduate I would have fully mastered these along with C, C++, and other programming languages. <br><br>

My primary professional goal is to become a video game developer, working in both solo and team based game projects. Even though I work best with a team, I also like pursuing some smaller projects by myself as well. I dream to develop entertainment software that is both technically well designed and also enjoyable for players. <br><br>

In the near future, I am looking for a software engineering or game development internship where I can apply my skills in programming into a real world environment. I wish to strengthen my skills in development as a team and software design. I strive to be as honest and high quality with my work, and can adapt to new technologies and complex problem solving.</p>
