      <h1>My biography</h1>
      <p>My name is Christian Lamas, I was born and raised in Orlando Florida. Currently I am studying at Florida Polytechnic University and am on my way to achieve a degree in Computer Science.</p>
      <p>I've always had an interest in technology, starting in sixth grade I took every class that was related to computers in some way. I took almost every computer class available in my school for both middle and high school. I love how hands on programming can be, and how satisfying it can be to successfully overcome challenges regarding it as well.</p>
      <p>Aside from the Computer Science field, I also enjoy creating and editing videos on YouTube. I really like expressing my creativity in this form.</p>
      <p>I strive to be honest about everything I do and to be a good example wherever I can. I hope that my future careers can meet my goals of success and enjoyment.</p>
